\abstract{
Texas Aerial Robotics will compete in Mission 7 of the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) in 2017. The goal is to direct Roombas (iRobot Create 2's), known as ground robots, using a quadcopter. We use a camera (put name here) for vision, a Nvidia Jetson for vision processing, and a Pixhawk for controlling the quadcopter.
